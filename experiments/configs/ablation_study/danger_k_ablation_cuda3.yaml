# Danger Set k Value Ablation Study Configuration - CUDA:3
#
# This configuration tests the sensitivity of k parameter in compute_danger_set,
# which determines the number of nearest neighbors used to identify "danger"
# minority samples near the decision boundary. These samples are prioritized
# in the triplet loss computation.

# Reference: Learning Majority-to-Minority Transformations with MMD and Triplet Loss
#            for Imbalanced Classification (arXiv:2509.11511)
#
# Reproducibility: Fixed seed (1203) for all random operations
# Metrics: AUROC, G-mean, MCC, F1-score
# GPU Assignment: cuda:3, Datasets 22-29 (of 29)
