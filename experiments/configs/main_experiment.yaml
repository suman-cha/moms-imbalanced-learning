# Main Experiment Configuration
# Paper: "Learning Majority-to-Minority Transformations with MMD and Triplet Loss 
#         for Imbalanced Classification" (arXiv:2509.11511)
#
# This configuration follows the hyperparameter settings from Section 4.2

# Dataset settings
data_source: "imblearn"  # "imblearn" or "custom"
data_path: null  # Set this for custom .dat datasets

# Training hyperparameters (Paper Section 4.2)
# λ = 0.01, k = 5, α = 1.0, Adam optimizer with default settings
n_epochs: 1000
lr: 0.01
beta: 0.01  # λ in paper - regularization coefficient

# Architecture (auto-scaled based on input dimension if null)
# Network capacity is automatically scaled based on input dimension d
hidden_dims: null  # Will use [d*2, d*4, d*8, d*16]
latent_dim: null  # Will use d*32

# Triplet loss settings (Paper Section 3.2)
k_neighbors: 5  # k in paper - number of neighbors for triplet mining
triplet_margin: 1.0  # α in paper - triplet loss margin

# MMD kernel settings
kernel_type: "gaussian"

# Evaluation settings (Paper Section 4.1)
# 10-fold cross-validation repeated over 10 independent trials
n_runs: 10
n_splits: 10
seed: 1203

# Output settings
save_path: "./results"
visualize: false

# Device settings
device: "cuda"
